# Data Analysis Portfolio of Meryem Camci

## About
Hi, I'm Meryem! I have a social and analytical background in Educational Psychology and Tourism Administration. I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my early career, I honed my ability to work with data analysis for e-commerce and digital marketing. I also gained experience in data management, A/B testing, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.
